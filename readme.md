# HTML5 Canvas, responsive.

**Getting `<canvas>` to look great is difficult. Making `<canvas>` responsive is even more difficult. VBCanvas is here to make it easy.**

VBCanvas allows you to define a canvas viewBox attribute just like SVG. Once set, the canvas will automatically position all drawing relative to the viewBox and scale the canvas automatically. Blissful!
